# JSON Documentation Enhancement Project

## Problem
JSON files don't support comments, so we can't add source/generation information directly to JSON files without breaking their syntax. This makes it difficult for developers to understand where these files come from and how to properly modify them.

## Potential Solutions

### 1. Documentation File
Create a GENERATED_FILES.md file that's generated alongside the project and includes:
- List of all generated files
- For each file: original template source, purpose, and modification instructions
- Special section for JSON files explaining their origins

### 2. Template Documentation
Enhance the EJS templates with detailed comments that explain the purpose and structure, serving as documentation for developers looking at the templates directly.

### 3. README Integration
Add a section to the generated README.md that explains the file structure, with particular focus on JSON files that can't contain self-documentation.

## Implementation Ideas

### For the Documentation File
- Generate it as part of the createServer function
- Include file paths, sources, and modification guidance
- Explain that JSON files cannot contain comments
- Use clear headers and organization to make it easy to find info on specific files

### For README Integration
- Add a "Project Structure" section to the README.md.ejs template
- List key files and their purposes
- Explain where templates can be found
- Provide guidelines for modifying generated files

## Action Items
1. Design the structure for a documentation file
2. Create a function to generate this documentation
3. Update the createServer function to also generate this file
4. Update README.md.ejs template to include file structure information
5. Test the solution with a new project generation

## Notes for Implementation
Remember that this documentation should be automatically generated and maintained, not requiring manual updates as the project evolves. Consider adding a mechanism to detect when templates cha
